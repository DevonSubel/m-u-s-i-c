As a DJ, I want to create playlists, so that I can play sets of songs that Iâ€™ve put together.
As a person new to rock, I want to find songs with similar characteristics, so that I can get into new music.
As a musician looking for inspiration, I want to listen to songs that are like the ones I write, so that I know what songs work.
