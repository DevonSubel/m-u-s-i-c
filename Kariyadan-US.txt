As a heavy user of the app, I want to start listening to recommended songs, so that I can quickly sort through a high volume of songs and identify those I like the most.
As a power user, I want the application to save my settings when I close the application, so that when I re-open the application I have a consistent user experience.
As a new user of the app, I want instructions for performing common tasks in the app, so that I can learn to effectively use the application.
